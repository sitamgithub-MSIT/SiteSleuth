# SiteSleuth

This project empowers users to get the most out of any website by analyzing its content and answering questions based on the information found. SiteSleuth utilizes an Artificial Conversational Entity powered by the Gemini API. To know more about the project, refer to the [blog post](https://medium.com/google-cloud/how-to-create-an-ai-powered-website-analysis-chatbot-37d1ea8c4684).

Below is a screenshot of SiteSleuth in action:

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Python is used as the primary programming language for this project.
- **Gemini API**: These APIs provide advanced natural language processing and computer vision capabilities.
- **Langchain**: Langchain is used for the RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) implementation.
- **Chroma DB**: Chroma DB is the vector store for the embeddings.
- **Streamlit**: Streamlit is used to build interactive UIs for the chat interface.
- **Docker**: Docker is used to containerize the application.
- **Cloud Run**: Google Cloud Run deploys the containerized application.
- **Cloud Build**: Google Cloud Build is used to set up the CI/CD pipeline.
- **LangSmith**: LangSmith is used for the tracing of the model calls.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/sitamgithub-MSIT/SiteSleuth.git`
2. Change the directory: `cd SiteSleuth`
3. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv tutorial-env`
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - Windows: `tutorial-env\Scripts\activate`
   - Unix-based systems: `source tutorial-env/bin/activate`
5. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Run the Gradio application: `streamlit run app.py`

**Note**: You need to have the Gemini API key to run the application. You can get the API key by signing up on the [Gemini API](https://aistudio.google.com/). Once you have the API key, create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables provided in the `.env.example` file. Replace the values with your API key.

```bash
GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY
USER_AGENT=YOUR_USER_AGENT_NAME
```

Open your local host to view the web application. For more information, consult the Streamlit documentation [here](https://docs.streamlit.io/). You can also access a live version of the application [here](https://sitesleuth-a4zzrfnhrq-uc.a.run.app/), which is deployed on Google Cloud Run.

## Deployment

The application is deployed on Google Cloud Run. Follow the Google Cloud Generative AI sample app [here](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/generative-ai/tree/main/gemini/sample-apps/gemini-streamlit-cloudrun) to deploy the application on Google Cloud Run. You can also refer to the dedicated blog post [here](https://medium.com/google-cloud/how-to-create-an-ai-powered-website-analysis-chatbot-37d1ea8c4684) for more details.

## Model Tracing

Model tracing is enabled using the LangSmith API. Refer to the documentation [here](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) to understand all the features provided by LangSmith. To enable model tracing, follow these steps:

- Obtain the LangSmith API key by signing up on the [LangSmith API](https://smith.langchain.com/).
- Set the `LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2` environment variable to `true` in the `.env` file.
- Set the `LANGCHAIN_API_KEY` and `LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT` environment variables to your LangSmith API key and endpoint, respectively.
- If you want to enable tracing for your project instead of the default LangSmith project, set the `LANGCHAIN_PROJECT` environment variable to your project name.
- You can refer to the environment variables provided in the `.env.example` file for guidance. Replace the values with your own.

```bash
LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=YOUR_LANGSMITH_API_KEY
LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT=URL_ENDPOINT
LANGCHAIN_PROJECT=YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
```

## Usage

Once the application is up and running, you can interact with the conversational entity through the provided UI. It can analyze the content of websites and answer your questions based on the information found.

### Example

1. Open the application in your browser.
2. Input a website link in the designated field.
3. Click the "Submit" button.
4. Once it's "Done", you can ask questions in the chatbot.
5. The chatbot will analyze the content and provide a detailed response.
6. You can also clear the chat history by clicking the "Clear History" button.
7. You can trace the model calls by enabling LangSmith tracing.

## Results

The AI chatbot can analyze the content of any website and answer questions based on the information found. The chatbot can provide detailed responses to the user queries. For results, refer to the `assets/` directory for the output screenshots, which show the chatbot responses for the given website as well as the model tracing.

## Conclusion

In this project, we have built an AI-powered chatbot that can analyze the content of any website and answer questions based on the information found. We have used the Gemini API for the natural language processing capabilities, LangSmith for the model tracing, and Langchain for the RAG implementation. Additionally, we have utilized Chroma DB for the vector store of the embeddings. The chatbot was built using Streamlit and Dockerized, and finally, deployed on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using the Cloud Run service with a CI/CD pipeline using Cloud Build.
