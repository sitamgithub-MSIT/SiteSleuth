# Gemini PDF Chatbot

Gemini PDF Chatbot is a Streamlit-based application that allows users to chat with a conversational AI model trained on PDF documents. The chatbot extracts information from uploaded PDF files and answers user questions based on the provided context.

## Features

- **PDF Upload:** Users can upload multiple PDF files.
- **Text Extraction:** Extracts text from uploaded PDF files.
- **Conversational AI:** Uses the Gemini conversational AI model to answer user questions.
- **Chat Interface:** Provides a chat interface to interact with the chatbot.

## Getting Started

If you have docker installed, you can run the application using the following command:

- Obtain a Google API key and set it in the `.env` file.

   ```.env
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Your application will be available at <http://localhost:8501>.

### Deploying your application to the cloud

First, build your image, e.g.: `docker build -t myapp .`.
If your cloud uses a different CPU architecture than your development
machine (e.g., you are on a Mac M1 and your cloud provider is amd64),
you'll want to build the image for that platform, e.g.:
`docker build --platform=linux/amd64 -t myapp .`.

Then, push it to your registry, e.g. `docker push myregistry.com/myapp`.

Consult Docker's [getting started](https://docs.docker.com/go/get-started-sharing/)
docs for more detail on building and pushing.
